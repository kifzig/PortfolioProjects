## Presentations

[Cyclistic Bike Share Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Omxdm-CX72FnN-4j-oA7WHJS4WoApaaGYp8-pN8kG_o/edit?usp=sharing) - It includes my SQL queries at the end of the presentation.


## Python Work Productivity Projects 

[Constant Contact List Splitter](https://github.com/kifzig/emailblast_splitter) - This helped to create multiply mailing lists to send email campaigns on the behalf of the sales staff. I also created a [GUI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yul9tvsQsGZA5KOtS0mPl0BoDa0HJ9Dl/view) for the script so I could share it with a coworker.

[Constant Contact Report Creater](https://github.com/kifzig/cc_open_report_creater) - This python project uses pandas, xlswriter and PySimpleGUI to provide an interface to quickly take email campaign statistical reports from Constant Contact (csvs) and collocate and clean it into an Excel sheet for my colleagues at work. It reduces my time creating these routine reports by an hour.


## Python Projects

[Rock Paper Scissors with Graphical User Interface](https://github.com/kifzig/rock-paper-scissors) - This is a game that I decided to make on my own as part of my Nucamp portfolio.

[Rental Tracker](https://github.com/kifzig/aws_rental) - This was my first time putting together a small website using Flask, HTML, and PostgreSQL. I containerized it using Docker and then deployed it to Amazon Web Services where I connected it to a new database on Amazon RDS, created an image using Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and ran it on Elastic Container Service.


## Software Engineering Projects
[Sample Blog using Flask, Bootstrap, and Python](https://github.com/kifzig/day59_python_blog_bootstrap_flask) - This is not deployed.

[Around the U.S.](https://github.com/kifzig/se_project_aroundtheus) - This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to load images and display them dynamically in a grid.

[Practicum Coffee Shop](https://kifzig.github.io/se_project_coffeeshop/) - This is an HTML and CSS project that utilizes flexbox.
