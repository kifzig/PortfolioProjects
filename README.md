# Portfolio Projects

This is my portfolio where I will share projects I've completed in Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. I'm a former teacher learning
everything that I can about Data Analytics.

## Tableau

## Presentations

[Cyclistic Bike Share Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Omxdm-CX72FnN-4j-oA7WHJS4WoApaaGYp8-pN8kG_o/edit?usp=sharing) - It includes my SQL queries at the end of the presentation.

## Python Work Productivity Projects 

[Constant Contact List Splitter](https://github.com/kifzig/emailblast_splitter) - This helped to create multiply mailing lists to send email campaigns on the behalf of the sales staff. I also created a [GUI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yul9tvsQsGZA5KOtS0mPl0BoDa0HJ9Dl/view) for the script so I could share it with a coworker.

## Python Projects

[Rock Paper Scissors with Graphical User Interface](https://github.com/kifzig/rock-paper-scissors) - This is a game that I decided to make on my own as part of my Nucamp portfolio.
